# Phase 4: System Integration Stories

## Story 1: Implement System Tray Functionality
**As a** developer  
**I want to** add system tray integration  
**So that** the app can run in the background while being easily accessible  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create system tray icon with the app logo
- Implement minimize to tray functionality
- Add context menu with options: Open, Exit
- Show volume percentage in tray icon tooltip
- Double-clicking tray icon should restore the main window
- Allow volume adjustment directly from tray context menu

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use NotifyIcon component from Windows.Forms (will require reference)
- Consider adding keyboard shortcut information in the context menu
- Ensure clean application shutdown when exiting from tray
- Test with various Windows taskbar configurations

## Story 2: Create Application Settings
**As a** developer  
**I want to** implement persistent application settings  
**So that** user preferences are preserved between sessions  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Save and restore window position and size
- Remember last selected audio device
- Store theme preference
- Save minimized to tray state
- Implement startup behavior setting (normal, minimized, minimized to tray)
- Create basic settings UI

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use built-in .NET settings capabilities
- Store settings in user profile location for portability
- Handle corrupted settings gracefully
- Keep settings file lightweight

## Story 3: Package as Single Executable
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create a single-file executable package  
**So that** the app can be easily deployed without installation  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create self-contained deployment package
- Bundle all dependencies within a single EXE
- Ensure proper versioning information
- Keep file size reasonable (<50MB)
- Verify functionality on clean Windows install
- Implement proper application icon and metadata

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use .NET's single-file publishing capability
- Trim unused assemblies if possible to reduce size
- Test on both Windows 10 and 11
- Verify application runs without administrative privileges
- Test on systems without .NET runtime installed

## Story 4: Add Global Hotkey Support
**As a** developer  
**I want to** implement global hotkeys  
**So that** users can control volume from anywhere  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Add customizable global hotkeys for volume up/down/mute
- Implement hotkey configuration UI
- Prevent conflicts with existing system hotkeys
- Show notification when hotkeys are used
- Ensure hotkeys work even when app is minimized to tray

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use low-level keyboard hooks or registered hotkeys API
- Consider accessibility implications
- Allow disabling hotkeys if desired
- Test with various keyboard layouts
