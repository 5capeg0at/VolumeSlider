# Phase 1: Core Audio Control Stories

## Story 1: Create Basic Project Structure
**As a** developer  
**I want to** set up a WPF project with the necessary references  
**So that** I can build upon a solid foundation  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a new WPF application in C#
- Add necessary references for Core Audio API (might require NAudio NuGet package)
- Create a clear folder structure (Models, ViewModels, Views, Services)
- Ensure the project builds successfully
- Include a basic application icon

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use .NET 6.0 or later for better single-file packaging support
- Consider MVVM architecture for cleaner separation of concerns
- Add appropriate error handling infrastructure

## Story 2: Implement Volume Control Service
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create a service that interacts with the Windows audio system  
**So that** we can retrieve and adjust the system volume  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create AudioService class that can get the current master volume
- Implement method to set the master volume with 1% precision
- Add functionality to mute/unmute the audio
- Include proper error handling for audio API calls
- Ensure the service works independently of the UI

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Core Audio API via NAudio or direct COM interop
- Implement IDisposable pattern for proper resource management
- Create events for volume changes that can be subscribed to
- Test the service with a simple console application before UI integration

## Story 3: Implement Audio Device Enumeration
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create functionality to list and select audio devices  
**So that** users can control different playback devices  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Enumerate all available audio playback devices
- Get properties for each device (name, ID, current status)
- Implement method to set the default playback device
- Handle device connection/disconnection events
- Allow retrieving and setting volume for specific devices

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create a device manager class separate from the volume service
- Consider implementing event-based notifications for device changes
- Create appropriate models for device information
- Test with multiple devices (including virtual ones if hardware is limited)
