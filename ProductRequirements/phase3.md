# Phase 3: Enhanced UI Features Stories

## Story 1: Implement Dark/Light Mode
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create theme support for the application  
**So that** it matches the user's system preferences  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create resource dictionaries for dark and light themes
- Implement automatic theme detection based on Windows settings
- Allow manual theme switching through a toggle
- Ensure all UI elements adapt appropriately to theme changes
- Maintain sufficient contrast in both themes for accessibility

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use system accent colors when possible
- Create a ThemeService to handle theme changes
- Test with Windows high contrast settings
- Consider color-blind friendly design choices

## Story 2: Add Volume Change Animation
**As a** developer  
**I want to** implement subtle animations for volume changes  
**So that** users get visual feedback when volume is adjusted  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a subtle animation that plays when volume changes
- Implement a visual indicator that reflects current volume level
- Ensure animations are smooth and non-disruptive
- Make animations respect system animation settings
- Keep animations brief (under 300ms)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use WPF storyboards for animations
- Consider custom control if needed
- Implement animation throttling to prevent UI lag during rapid changes
- Test performance on lower-end devices

## Story 3: Implement Device Selection Dropdown
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create a device selection interface  
**So that** users can switch between audio devices  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a dropdown listing all available audio devices
- Show the current default device as selected
- Update list dynamically when devices are added/removed
- Show device status (e.g., active, disconnected)
- Allow selecting a device to make it the default

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use ComboBox or custom control for device selection
- Consider custom item template to show device details
- Implement background device monitoring
- Handle edge cases like sudden device disconnection

## Story 4: Add Mouse Wheel Support
**As a** developer  
**I want to** implement mouse wheel volume adjustment  
**So that** users can quickly change volume without precise clicking  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Enable mouse wheel scrolling to adjust volume up/down
- Make adjustments respect the 1% increment requirement
- Allow configurable scroll sensitivity
- Ensure volume changes are immediately reflected in the UI
- Mouse wheel should work when hovering over the slider or nearby

**Implementation Notes:**
- Handle PreviewMouseWheel event at window level for better UX
- Consider modifier keys (e.g., Ctrl+wheel for finer adjustments)
- Test with various mouse types and wheel sensitivities
