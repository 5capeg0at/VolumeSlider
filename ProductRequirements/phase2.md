    # Phase 2: Basic UI Stories

## Story 1: Create Main Window Layout
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create the main application window  
**So that** users can interact with the volume controls  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a resizable but compact window (default size around 300x200 pixels)
- Implement a clean, minimal design following modern UI principles
- Include a volume slider control
- Add volume percentage display
- Include placeholder for device selection
- Add basic app title and minimize/close buttons

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Grid layout for responsive positioning
- Ensure controls have appropriate tab order
- Consider accessibility from the beginning
- Focus on layout only; functionality will be connected later

## Story 2: Implement Volume Slider
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create a volume slider control with precise control  
**So that** users can adjust volume with 1% increments  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement a horizontal slider with range 0-100
- Display tick marks for every 10% increment
- Enable smooth sliding with 1% precision
- Style the slider to match modern Windows UI
- Ensure the slider height and handle size allow for easy interaction

**Implementation Notes:**
- May require custom slider template for visual styling
- Consider custom control if standard slider doesn't offer enough customization
- Ensure slider thumb is easily clickable
- Test slider behavior with both mouse and touch input

## Story 3: Connect Volume Control Service to UI
**As a** developer  
**I want to** integrate the audio service with the UI controls  
**So that** the slider reflects and controls the actual system volume  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Bind slider value to the system volume
- Update percentage display when volume changes
- Implement two-way binding (UI changes volume and system changes update UI)
- Ensure smooth updates without UI freezing
- Handle potential errors from audio service gracefully

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use MVVM pattern for clean separation
- Implement property change notifications
- Consider using async calls for potentially lengthy operations
- Add basic error messages visible to the user
- Test with rapidly changing volume to ensure UI responsiveness
